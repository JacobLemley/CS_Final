You wake up -- on an icy ground to a cold breeze gushing at you from every direction, the air is dry. You look up and there are mountain ranges surrounding you from lengths of 2,400 km. The feeling of confusion is creeping up on you -- "how did I get here?" A wooden board on your far left say, "Welcome to the Himalayas," but there is no one to be found. The view is beautiful yet ominous since ice caps are melting around you and the famous Himalayan black-necked cranes skull is surrounding you in masses. You walk across the still river in hope to find someone, but you find yourself in loss of words as you see a village flooded from afar. As a UT environment student, you believe it is your responsibility to report this to the world by taking up any remaining artifacts -- the problem is that one of the artifacts will take you back home without any recollection of your stay at the Himalaya's, so be careful in what you chose to pick up. Also, the goal is to collect as many artifacts/details as you can.
