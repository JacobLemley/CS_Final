--------------------The River--------------------
INITIAL
Welcome to the river! The water is rapidly rushing past you and splashing you as hits the nearby rocks.  It looks quite dangerous but you can see something across the river that you can't quite make out.
NORMAL
Welcome back to the river.  The well is still on the other side and the current is still strong.
LOCATIONS
well:west
sign:east
OBJECTS
rock:There is a really nice rock that is quite pretty and shows some good old sedimentary layers.  Depending on how into rocks you are, you may want to carry it around with you to bring to your people back home.
fish:There are fish in the river.  If you want to try to grab one from the river, be might guest.  Might stink up your inventory, but might taste good in a pinch.
