OBJECTS
batteries:They're fresher than veggies getting misted at the grocery store.
crystallball:It's purple and swirly but you don't know how to read it like a real psychic could.
fossil:It's petrified and is for sure old.  Its age is probably higher than you can count.  Looks like a fossil of some kind of crane foot.  Dang cranes.
