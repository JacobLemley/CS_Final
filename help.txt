Welcome to your help functionality!

Your four main functions are:
    - pick up an object
    - drop an object
    - look
    - go to

To use the pick up function, enter "pick up" (or a synonym) + the object.
To use the drop function, enter "drop" (or a synonym) + the object.

You can use the look function to either look at your surroundings or an item.
    - To look at an object, enter "look" (or a synonym) + object.
    - Otherwise, just enter look (or a synonym) to see your surroundings in your current location.

Your movements can be North, South, East, or West.
Enter "go north" (or a synonym) or any of the other directions to move that way.
There are some places on the map where you can only go specific directions.
To use the map functionality, enter "map."

To exit the game, you may enter "exit" at any time.

You can access this function anytime, the same way you got here.

Safe travels, adventurer!
