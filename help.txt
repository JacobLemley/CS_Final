Welcome to your help functionality!
Your four main functions are:
    - pick up an object
    - drop an object
    - look
    - move

To use the pick up function, enter "pick up" (or a synonym) + the object.
To use the drop function, enter "drop" (or a synonym) + the object.
You can use the look function to either look at your surroundings or an item.
    - To look at an object, enter "look" (or a synonym) + object.
    - Otherwise, just enter look (or a synonym) to see your surroundings.

Your movements can be North, South, East, or West.
Enter "go north" (or a synonym) or any of the other directions to move that way.
There are some places on the map where you can only go specific directions.
You will have to figure these out yourself.

You can access this function anytime, the same way you got here.

Safe travels, adventurer!
